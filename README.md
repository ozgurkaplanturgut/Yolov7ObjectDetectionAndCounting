# Yolov7ObjectDetectionAndCounting

## About the repo

This repo is the example of detecting objects via class-based inference structure and counting specified objects, from WonKinYiu/yolov7

## Get Started

Before everything, you must have cuda-cudnn-torch installed. (Preffered Cuda-11.3, Cudnn-8.2.1 and Pytorch for Cuda 11.3)

!!! Use pip3 instead of pip for python3.x 

```
https://github.com/ozgurkaplanturgut/Yolov7ObjectDetectionAndCounting.git
cd Yolov7ObjectDetectionAndCounting
pip3 install -r requirements
```

If the above instructions gives error, you can do;

1-) Download this repo as a zip file

2-) Extract the zip file

3-) Then get in the extracted file, open terminal and command pip3 install -r requirements.txt

After these points, you are free to run yolor_inference.py file.
